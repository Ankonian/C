Memory leak error: Valgrind said the memory was allocated on line 444. The realloc function allocated the lost memory.

Arraylist.c program ask user for action: insert new number, print out numbers stored, or quit the program.
Inserting new number will add a new number input from the user to the array, if the array is full, reallocate more memory and expand the length of the array
Printing numbers will print all the numbers user input in the duration of the program
Quit will kill the program and free the memory allocated
