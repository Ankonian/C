This program takes in a text file or standard input and pick out words that are considered bad and either suggest replacement or sent to joycamp. The printHT function would only print empty spaces. I know that I won't get higher than 50% in this assignment, I am fully assured that I will retake this class, so I don't really care about grade at this point, I just want to know what I did wrong and what I can do to fix it. Can the grader tell me what went wrong is the comment when the grade's uploaded?
